						<h2>Athletics for Grown-ups</h2>
						<p>Aduletics is a run club and a runner's school all in one. It's much more than just 'going for a run'. Our focus is about teaching runners how to run, and to equip our runners with the tools they need to train both the brain AND the body.</p>
                        <p>We're all about building stronger AND smarter runners, so there is just as much an emphasis on running technique, skill development, injury prevention and education as there is on the actual programming.</p>

								<h3>Running development</h3>
							</header>
							<p>All of our weekly structured running sessions (including intervals, hills, tempo & aerobic training) are accompanied by running drills to work on technique development, both to improve running efficiency & reduce risk of injury. We place a large emphasis on explaining the ‘why’s’ of our training, the purpose of each type of session, what each drill is working to improve and educating our runners.</p>

								<h3>Strength training</h3>
							</header>
							<p>Every week our program includes 2 x strength training sessions, designed specifically for runners. Strength training is SO important not only for improving performance but also to help prevent running injuries, and is an essential part of all our runners’ training.</p>

								<h3>Education</h3>
							</header>
							<p>Our philosophy at Adultletics is to equip our runners with the tools they need to improve not only from a performance perspective, but to learn how to listen to our bodies, optimise running form, recover better, and ultimately become more informed, happier and healthier runners. We do this by explaining the purpose of every session and technique drill, holding weekly educational webinars with a different focus every week, a daily challenge that changes weekly with either a physical or mentor focus, and answering all questions that our members have in regards to any aspect of their training.</p>

								<h3>Social connection</h3>
							</header>
							<p>Adultletics believes running is better done with others. It’s more fun, more sustainable, and you are more likely to achieve your goals, whatever they may be. For this reason we have built our club into an online running community - this is where not only the program for the week is shared as well as our educational content, but members’ questions are answered, members share their progress, accomplishments & struggles, as well as how they felt during certain sessions, and general banter!</p>

                                <h4 onclick="faqToggle( 1 )">Will Adultletics cater for my ability?</h4>
                                <p style="display: none;">Adultletics provides variations of every component of the weekly program to cater for the absolute newbie to the well-trained and experienced runner.<br />We offer programs based on the event you are training for, from 5km to ultra marathon distances.</p>
                            </div>
                        </div>

                                <h4 onclick="faqToggle( 2 )">I currently have an injury and am not allowed to run, can I still join?</h4>
                                <p style="display: none;">Absolutely! Depending on the injury, there is almost certainly still training that you CAN do. Please contact us to discuss your specific injury so we can tailor the structured running and strength sessions for you with appropriate alternatives. For all other components, you will be able to participate in the same way as all other members. We want to ensure that when you are recovered from injury, you can hit the ground running!</p>
