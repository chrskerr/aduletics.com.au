						<h2>Join our 2 Week Run Challenge!</h2>
                        <p>We get it. Your race has been postponed, running groups have been canceled, the gyms are still closed...</p>
                        <p>To keep you all moving & developing as runners, we've created a two week running challenge ending in a virtual race, and it's going to be epic! We have prepared a jam packed 14 days, including structured running sessions (feat. intervals, tempo & aerobic training and more), strength sessions designed specifically for runners, technique drills, daily challenges, educational webinars, connection to a group of like minded runners, unlimited access to the coaches and a virtual race to wrap up the challenge.</p>
                        <p><strong>The challenge will start Monday 11th May.</strong></p>
                        <p>Our philosophy: Aduletics is a run club and a runner's school all in one. It's much more than just 'going for a run'. Our focus is about teaching runners how to run, and to equip our runners with the tools they need to train both the brain AND the body.</p>

								<h3>Running sessions</h3>
							</header>
							<p>Each week incldues 3 x structured running sessions (feat. intervals, tempo & aerobic training and more), all accompanied by running drills to work on technique development, to improve running efficiency & reduce risk of injury. We place a large emphasis on explaining the ‘why’s’ of our training, the purpose of each session, what each drill is working to improve and educating our runners.</p>

								<h3>Strength training</h3>
							</header>
							<p>Each week of the challenge includes 2 x strength training sessions, designed specifically for runners. Strength training is SO important not only for improving performance but also to help prevent running injuries, and is an essential part of all our runners’ training.</p>

								<h3>Education</h3>
							</header>
							<p>Our philosophy at Adultletics is to equip our runners with the tools they need to improve not only from a performance perspective, but to learn how to listen to our bodies, optimise running form, recover better, and ultimately become more informed, happier and healthier runners. We do this by explaining the purpose of every session and technique drill, holding weekly educational webinars, a daily challenge that changes weekly with either a physical or mentor focus, and answering all questions our members have in regards to any aspect of their training.</p>

								<h3>Social connection</h3>
							</header>
							<p>Adultletics believes running is better done with others. It’s more fun, more sustainable, and you are more likely to achieve your goals, whatever they may be. For this reason we have structured this challenge to include an online running community - this is where we will share the sessions for the week, the educational content, answer members’ questions, and participants can share their progress, accomplishments & struggles, as well as how they felt during certain sessions, and general banter!</p>

                                <p style="display: none;">Adultletics provides variations of every component of the challenge to cater for the absolute newbie to the well-trained and experienced runner.<br />We offer variations based on the race distance you are training for, from 5km to ultra marathon distances.</p>

For all other components, you will be able to participate in the same way as all other members. We want to ensure that when you are recovered from injury, you can hit the ground running!</p>
